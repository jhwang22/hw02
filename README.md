## Top 10 States with Highest Homelessness Rates****

This graph shows 10 states with the highest homelessness rate as of 2020 (per 10,000 people). I got the data from [Statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/727847/homelessness-rate-in-the-us-by-state/). This data was actually pulled from a survey conducted by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development. The survey results were relased March 2021, so what you're seeing is hot off the press.

## Homelessness in the U.S.****

Here I examined homelessness rates in the U.S from 2007 to 2018. I got the data from [datahub.io](https://datahub.io/gavram/homelessness#readme). I examined homeless people who were either sheltered or unsheltered. It's worth noting that these numbers, while also pulled from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, may actually be underreporting the homeless population, since it is very challenging to count the homeless.
